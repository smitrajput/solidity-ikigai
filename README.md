Esoteric Solidity gas-optimisations + security learnings.

## Solidity Doc Notes

1. Size of string literal “smit” is 4 bytes. Size of hex string literal hex”face” is 2 bytes.
2. contract X is MostBaseLike, MostDerived { constructor() {} }.
   1. order of contracts needs to be ‘written’ in the way shown above to allow solidity to compile. It basically says MostDerived contract needs to override MostBaseLike contract
   2. constructors will be called in the following order: MostBaseLike → MostDerived → X
3. bytes, strings are right-padded, when converting them to 32-bytes (during encoding for e.g)
4. abi.encode/encoeWithSelector/encodeWithSignature: static types encoded in place | position of dynamic types (relative to this encoding) | data of dynamic types (first length | then actual data). A call to a function with the signature `f(uint256,uint32[],bytes10,bytes)` with values `(0x123, [0x456, 0x789], "1234567890", "Hello, world!")` is encoded as

```js
positions 0x8be65246 // selector
0x00  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000123 // in-place 0x123
0x20  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080 // position of start of [0x456, 0x789]
0x40  3132333435363738393000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 // "1234567890"'s ASCII right-padded
0x60  00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e0 // position of start of "Hello, world!"
0x80  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 //  start of [0x456, 0x789]
0xa0  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000456
0xc0  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000789
0xe0  000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d // start of "Hello, world!"
0x100  48656c6c6f2c20776f726c642100000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

5. abi.encodePacked():
   1. all types except arrays are packed unpadded (even strings, bytes are unpadded unless inside arrays)
   2. all dynamic types are packed **_without_** length
   3. all elements in array are padded (even strings, bytes)
6. calldata access in Yul: `x.length` for its length, `x.offset` for its byte-offset. They can be assigned to, though without any validation to be less than `calldatasize()`
7. storage access in Yul: `x.slot` for its slot, `x.offset` for its byte-offset. They cannot be assigned to.
8. Enable auto-gas-optimisation by compiler using `—via-ir` for compiling, which is a new code generation path for converting solidity code to opcodes. It only works if there is no inline assembly or if there is, then it is `memory-safe`. Now, inline assembly is memory-safe when all the memory that is accessed inside the assembly block is:

   1. scratch space (`0x00 - 0x3f`)
   2. allocated by solidity, for e.g. accessing memory within bounds of pre-created memory array
   3. allocated by you, for e.g. {don’t this and (d) contradict?}

      ```solidity
      // allocating 'length' more bytes
      assembly {
      	let pos := mload(0x40)
        mstore(0x40, add(pos, length))
      }
      ```

   4. allocated by the free memory pointer (`0x40`), without updating the free memory pointer, for e.g.

      ```solidity
      assembly ("memory-safe") {
        let p := mload(0x40)
        returndatacopy(p, 0, returndatasize())
        revert(p, returndatasize())
      }
      ```

   **_Hence, the best way to create most gas-optimised code is by using both `—via-ir` and `memory-safe-assembly`._**

### Issues / Potential PRs

1. [Link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/abi-spec.html#types): `int<M>`: two’s complement signed integer type of `M` bits, `0 < M <= 256`, `M % 8 == 0.` How come `256` for `int`?
2. [Link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode): ‘Furthermore, structs as well as nested arrays are not supported.’ Then also, ‘The encoding of `string` or `bytes` does not apply padding at the end, unless it is part of an array or **_struct_** (then it is padded to a multiple of 32 bytes)’. struct? Choose a side, bitch.
3. [Link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/assembly.html#things-to-avoid): what exactly are we avoiding here?

## PwningEth Blog Summaries

1. Aurora: delegatecall precompile depositETH contract (from malicious contract) that emits legit looking event but doesn’t really check if ETH was actually deposited. Because msg.value on malicious contract will persist as msg.value for precompile, and because it’s a precompile (special contract that extends EVM), smh its logic==state, even though malicious contract’s state should have been retained (coz that’s how delegatecall works) and aurora engine should have been able to distinguish this event from event generated on normal call (but it doesn’t).
2. Moonbeam: delegatecall retains msg.sender, and for precompile contracts logic==state. Make innocent callers call malicious contract and use this call to delegatecall to ‘asset’ precompile contracts, to give the attacker infinite approvals on these assets..
3. Polkadot Frontier EVM: ETH balances limit → 256 bits while Polka substrate balances limit → 128 bits. Bypass EVM implementation of transfer using (1 << 128) to 0 truncate and then add more balance to give attacker huge balance on transfer of wrapped assets.

# Secureum Bootcamp

## Till Solidity 201

1. Read eth white paper
2. P2P network on TCP Port: 30303 on protocol named DevP2P
3. Decentralization: combination of Hardware, Software, Wetware (people, orgs)
4. ECDSA used to implement public key cryptography in eth. Elliptic curve with finite fields
5. private key -> 1 point of its elliptic curve -> public key -> keccak256 hash -> last 20 bytes -> address
6. Patricia tree => prefix tree: key prefixes keep increasing from root leaves determining path to data
7. eth uses Hexagonal Merkle Patricia Tree => each node has 16 children
8. EVM is Quasi Turing Complete as computations are Gas bounded
9. EVM stack has max 1024 elements each with max size 256 bits (word)
10. EVM ordering is Big-endian (most significant byte on lowest address and ...)
11. ORIGIN vs CALLER opcode??
12. 'constant' is more gas-efficient than 'immutable' coz immutable reserves a 256 bit storage slot always.
13. functions existing outside of contract are called free-functions. They're file-level. They implicitly are 'internal', and are included in all contracts that call them, similar to internal library functions
14. indexed params in events are bit more gaseous than non-indexed params
15. min:1, max: 256 constants can be specified in an enum
16. constructors are optional
17. receive() => eth send, no calldata, cannot return data ||| fallback() => no match, no receive(), can receive/return data, payable for ETH
18. functions/contracts/state variables are visible before declaration
19. Solidity doesn't support fixed point math. Need to use => PRBMath, DSMath etc
20. address payable can be converted to address and vice versa. Also ==, != etc operators can be used with 'address'. Also address.balance, address.code, address.codehash exist
21. address.transfer() REVERTS on destination contract consuming more than 2300 gas. address.send() DOES NOT REVERT, but returns 0,1. send() is lower level alt of transfer
22. staticcall is delegatecall which can only read state of caller contract and NOT MODIFY it. Return value check is important for these calls.
23. 'contract' type can be converted to and from 'address' type. 'contract' type has no operators, but can only be used to access its member functions, (public/external) state variables
24. bytes and byte[] are dynamic byte arrays. bytes >>> byte[] as byte[] wastes 31 bytes of memory for every array element due to padding rules
25. string => supports ascii + escape characters
26. unicode => supports any utf-8 sequence => needs to be prefixed with 'unicode' keyword
27. hex => supports hex digits => prefix with 'hex' keyword
28. function types => variable to which a function can be assigned, be used like other vars
29. 4 storage places in EVM: stack, memory, storage, calldata
30. calldata: non-modifiable non-persistent, used mainly for storing arguments of external fn calls but can be used for other vars too
31. Assignment semantics: memory-memory and storate-storage => reference, storage-memory and others => copy
32. array members: .length, .push, .push(x), .pop || .push only increases size and returns reference to new element while .push(x) appends 'x' and returns nothing
33. string == bytes except it doesn't allow length/index access
34. memory arrays can ONLY BE FIXED SIZED.
35. Array Literals: comma separated list of elements in [ ]. For eg: [45, 89, 3]. Fixed one cannot be assigned to Dynamic one
36. array.push() is constant gas, array.pop() depends on size of element being removed
37. Array Slices only supported for 'calldata arrays'. X[start:end] => X[start] to X[end-1]
38. struct types CANNOT contain members of the same struct type.
39. mapping[key -> value]: key can ONLY be value type (not reference type), value can be ANY type. key is not really stored, its keccak256 hash is looked up. mappings cannot be (returned from functions and sent as arguments), also true for arrays/structs containing mappings.
40. delete essentially assigns default value to the var. delete arr[2] actually assigns 0 to 3rd element while keeping other 4 elements AND array length intact.
41. mappings inside structs won't be auto-set to default values when struct is delete'd
42. //exception to implicit conversions (done by compiler): int128 -> uint256, uint256 -> uint128 [2nd one doesn't make sense to me]
43. explicit conversions: most types eg: uint16 -> uint8 => higher order bits (left-side) are cut off || uint8 -> uint16 => padded on left. EXACT OPPOSITE for fixed-size BYTES: bytes16 -> bytes8 => lower order bits (right-side) are cut off || bytes8 -> bytes16 => padded on right
44. Literals (implicit) Conversions: decimals/hex -> integers works. (hex/string/hex string) -> fixed byte arrays IFF hex digits, #chars (for string) exactly fit
45. msg.sig: function signature in hex
46. abi.(encode, decode, encodeWithSelector, encodeWithSignature, encodePacked)
47. abi.encodePacked encodes the args WITHOUT padding => ambiguous
48. Math/Crypto fns: addmod(), mulmod(), keccak256(bytes memory), sha256(b m), ripemd160(b m), ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s). ecrecover() returns the address that signed the signature from sig details
49. ecrecover() is vulnerable to sig malleability attack i.e. 2 valid sigs possible coz of 2 possible values of s in v, r, s, 1 each in lower order and higher order. Openzeppelin's ECDSA fixes this by specifying v=27/28, s=lower
50. ETH sent via selfdestruct to a contract DOES NOT TRIGGER its receive()
51. If there's a revert after selfdestruct() in the same txn, it can undo contract destruction, as the chain-state is reverted back.
52. type(myContractName).name, .creationCode, .runtimeCode
53. type(myInterfaceName).interfaceId
54. type(myInteger).max, .min => returns min and max value of int type of myInteger. For eg 0 and 255 for uint8 myInteger
55. non-booleans CANNOT be (implicitly) converted to boolean. For eg if(1) != if(true)
56. assert() => invariants, internal errors || require() => external/user interactions/dependency errors
57. Exceptions: error signatures: Error(string) => external/user interaction errors, Panic(uint256) => internal errors/assertions
58. Low-level-calls: call/staticcall/delegatecall RETURN TRUE even if destination contract DOES NOT exist
59. Panic Error Code: 0x01 - false arg in assert, 0x11 - over/underflow, 0x12 - div/mod by 0, 0x31: pop() empty array, 0x32: out-of-bounds
60. revert([String]) vs revert CustomError([arg1, ...])
61. catch blocks: catch Error(string reason), catch Panic(uint256 errorCode), catch (bytes lowLevelData), catch
62. function that are not implemented and meant to be overriden by its derived classes must be marked 'virtual'. Functions which ARE overriding these virtual functions need to be marked 'override'.
63. During multiple inheritance, specify contracts from left to right as 'most base-like' to 'most derived'
64. C3 linearization: to call a fn specified in multiple base classes, compiler starts checking inherited contracts from right to left as specified on the first line i.e. contract A is B, C, D {} -> first D is checked, then C, B
65. abstract: at least 1 fn unimplemented, interface: no fn implemented, no constructor,state vars,inheritance, all fns external, library: logic used by contracts using delegatecall
66. using A for B => fns in library A are now attached to type B. For eg. using SafeMath for uint256. Their scope is restricted to contract itself since 0.7, before it was inherited by child contracts
67. to call a fn exactly 1 level up inheritance heirarchy, super.fnName() is used
68. on overriding fns, mutability changes are allowed only to more stricter forms: public -> external, non-payable -> view/pure, view -> pure. payable can't be changed to anything
69. all fns in interface are virtual by default
70. public state variables can override external fns in base classes that have same name, parameters and return-type as getter fns of these public state variables. But public state vars themselves cannot be overriden.
71. modifiers can be overriden exactly the way fns can be.
72. constructor of base classes are called using C3 linearization
73. Libraries ARE STATELESS. They don't have state vars, can't receive ETH, can't be destroyed, can't inherit or be inherited. Can be called directly only for view/pure fns, need to delegatecall to change state. Calling contract can supply state vars tho.
74. structs and arrays always start with new storage slot (instead of getting packed inside previous slots even if space is available). And following items also always start with new storage slots
75. inherited state vars are stored in C3 linearized fashion: most-base to most-derived, and vars of diff contracts can be packed in 1 slot if space allows
76. While packing storage of state vars, consider BOTH sizes of vars AND read/write preferences of those vars. Coz packing together vars which are not required to be read/written together can result in increased gas costs, instead of decreased ones. As the only var to be read needs to be isolated from others using masking of other vars which requires additional gas costs
77. Dynamic array A -> stored at slot P. Then at P, current size of A is stored. A[0] is stored at keccak256(P), A[1] at keccak256(P)+1 and so on. These can be packed together too if possible
78. Mapping M -> slot P: P stores nothing. M[key:k] i.e. value corresponding to 1st key, is stored at keccak256(h(k).P). h is 32 padded if k is value type. [h is keccak256() if k is string/byte type. → highly doubt this as k can never be reference type]
79. bytes and string (S) storage at slot P: so P stores S.length*2 + S[0] if S[0] <= 31 bytes. And P stores only S.length*2 + 1 and S[0] is stored at keccack256(P) if S[0] >= 32 bytes. Now in P, if right-most digit (lowest bit) is 1 => S[0] storage starts at keccack256(P) and if right-most digit is 0 => S[0] storage starts at P {corresponding to S.length\*2}.
80. 1st 4 reserved memory slots: 1st 2 as scratch space for hashing, 3rd as free memory pointer, 4th as zero slot: used as initial value for dynamic memory arrays
81. free memory pointer => location: 0x40, init value: 0x80, gets updated as memory gets used
82. memory CAN'T BE FREED manually. So NEVER assume default 0 values for memory locations.
83. Assembly: lang Yul, value types can directly be used as local vars, local vars that refer to memory/calldata evaluate to variable address NOT value hence effectively reference, storage vars defined by _.slot (location) and _.offset (position in that slot)
84. sol 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 breaking changes in Solidity 201 (Block 2): 28:00
85. mapping cannot be defined inside struct/array in memory (but allowed in storage) since Solidity 0.7
86. OZ's ERC777's hooks are 1 way to avoid approve/transferFrom
87. OZ's CREATE2 lib allows deploy(uint ethAmount, bytes32 salt, bytes bytecode) and computeAddress(bytes32 salt, bytecodehash) to deterministic contract addresses
88. OZ's Multicall lib to batch multiple txns into 1
89. OZ's String lib: toString(uint value): uint -> ASCII String Decimal, similarly for toHexSrting || UNCLEAR (probably 12 → hex’xyz’)
90. OZ's MerkleProof: to check if a leaf is part of a merkle tree or not
91. OZ's SignatureChecker lib allows creating signs for EOA (ECDSA) and for contracts (ERC-1271) for eg for smart wallets
92. OZ's EIP-712 lib allows signing and hashing of type structured data, instead of just binary blobs. Check if devs have specified chainID, contract address to prevent replay attacks
93. OZ's Escrow and ConditionalEscrow: conditional escrow provides condition on withdrawal, RefundEscrow: allows refund to multiple depositors, on top of ConditionalEscrow
94. OZ's ERC-165: to check if a contract supports a particular interface
95. OZ's SafeCast: for safe downcasting of types. For eg: uin256 -> uint128/uint64, simmy for int256
96. EnumerableMap: only exists for mapping (uint256 => address). Enumerable in O(n)
97. EnumberableSet: supported types: bytes/address/uint256. Enumerable in O(n)
98. BitMap: maps uint256 -> bool, wherein each bit in this uint256 var represents a bool
99. PaymentSplitter, TimelockController: for adding timelocks to a contract
100. Context: support for meta-txns, ERC2771Context: tx signer -> gas relay -> trusted forwarder (verifies txn) -> destination contract
101. MinimalForwarder: implements trusted forwarder in 100
102. Proxy: to implement proxy in proxy<>implementation contract pattern
103. ERC1967Proxy: 102, but upgradabale. Allows changing impl contract
104. TransparentUpgradableProxy: has Admin. All admin calls restricted to proxy contract. All non-admin calls delegated to impl contract. Hence solving selector clash problem between proxy and impl i.e. fn selector of proxy = impl, hence confused which one to call
105. ProxyAdmin: admin contract of 104
106. BeaconProxy: 102, but impl address coming from UpgradeableBeacon contract and it is stored at ERC1967 specified slot
107. UpgradeableBeacon: support BeaconProxy to point to impl contract
108. Clones: impl ERC1167 ie Minimal Proxy contracts: where all impl contracts are clones of a specific bytecode, and all calls are delegated to known fixed address
109. Initializable: impl contracts NEED to impl initialize() to initialise the state of proxy contract RIGHT after impl contract is created (in context of proxy’s state || also in context of its own state), and this initialize() must only be callable ONCE. So Initializable lib helps impl contracts in implementing this. impl contract's constructor cannot be used for this, as that can only change state of impl contract, not of proxy's
110. While both of these share the same interface for upgrades, in UUPS (**Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard**) proxies the upgrade is handled by the implementation, and can eventually be removed. Transparent proxies, on the other hand, include the upgrade and admin logic in the proxy itself. This means `[TransparentUpgradeableProxy` 28](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy)
      is more expensive to deploy than what is possible with UUPS proxies.
111. Dappsys' DSProxy: 102, but also allows CREATION of impl contract along with making calls to it
112. DSMath: SafeMath + fixed-point math + wad (18 decimals), ray (27 decimals) support (wmul, wdiv, rmul, rdiv, rpow)
113. DSAuth: enables authorisation by DSGuard: has access control list (ACL) of [srcAddr][fnSign][destAddr] => boolean
114. DSRoles: role based ACL, Root Users, Public Capabilities, Role Capabilities -> non-root, non-public capabs

## Security Pitfalls, Best Practices 101

1. derived contracts calling unimplemented constructors of base contracts
2. from v0.4.5 to v0.6.8, non-payable constructors that had base constructors defined, DID NOT REVERT when ether was sent to them
3. ERC777 contract hooks can be used to re-enter caller contracts. Hence ensure no external calls are being made in hooks.
4. use oracles to access non-manipulable time on-chain, and not block.timestamp etc
5. to change approve(100) to approve(50), use decreaseAllowance(50), and not 2 approve txns of 100, 50, as in latter 2nd approve txn can be front-run to consume total approval of 150
6. 1 way to generate sign without private key is by using ‘s’ in higher range in ecrecover(v,r,s) if ‘s’ is in lower-range in ecrecover, and vice-versa, i.e. (49) in ‘Till Solidity 201’ section
7. all transfer()s should ideally return a bool according to ERC20 spec, but there are many who don’t, esp. contracts ≥ 0.4.22 that don’t return a bool, revert. SafeERC20 is a fix
8. similarly, ownerOf() in ERC721 supposed to return address, but contracts ≥ 0.4.22 revert when returned bool. OZ’s ERC721 is a fix
9. unexpected ETH balance change in contract: (1) contract’s a coinbase tx recipient (2) contract’s a selfdestruct() tx recipient
10. use tx.origin for ‘man in the middle’ attack as destination contract won’t realise the meddling
11. mappings INSIDE struct DON’T get deleted when struct is deleted
12. view/pure functions revert on state change ONLY after v0.5.0
13. low-level calls DO NOT REVERT on failing coz they return bools. ALSO, check their destination contract for existence, as these calls return true even if it does not exist
14. shadowing of now, assert etc, and state vars of base contracts by derived contracts was removed in later sol versions
15. in sol < 0.5.0, local vars could be used before declarations
16. loop index in loops is user-controlled ⇒ DoS
17. x =+ 1 ⇒ x assigned 1, as +1 is unary = 1. Unary operators deprecated since v0.5.0
18. Critical addresses should be changed in 2 steps and not 1. That is, grant/approve + claim by new address, instead of direct change to new address
19. DON’T make state changes INSIDE assert predicates. assert() → invariants (failures not expected), require() → validate user inputs (failures expected). Before v0.8.0, assert used INVALID opcode which consumed all remaining gas, require used REVERT opcode which refunded it. After 0.8, both are REVERT
20. for sol < 0.5.0, visibility of fns was optional and defaulted to public. After, it became mandatory
21. while defining inheritance list, recommended order is from Most general → Most specific
22. structs/arrays/mappings as fn parameters were optionally required to specify memory/storage for call by value/reference before v0.5.0. Became mandatory after
23. use of fn type vars in assembly can cause arbitrary jumps to code parts
24. use abi.encode() > abi.encodePacked() as encodePacked results in hash collisions when multiple variable length args are being used, as encodePacked doesn’t zero-pad the args and also doesn’t save args length, for packing. If super-necessary to use encodePacked, ensure only 1 variable length arg
25. variables with size < 32 bytes have dirty bits remaining on higher-order bits, due to previous writes. This data when passed as [msg.data](http://msg.data) can cause malleability/non-uniqueness
26. in assembly, shl(x,y), shr(x,y), sar(x,y) [shift arithmetic right] means shift y by x bits, and NOT other way round
27. RTLO: right-to-left-override Unicode char U+202E tricks users/auditors, hence avoid
28. uninitialized (local) storage variable pointers can point to unexpected storage locations, hence were removed from solc ≥ 0.5.0
29. uninitialized fn pointers showed unexpected behaviour inside constructor in 0.4.5 - 0.4.26 and 0.5.0 - 0.5.7. Then fixed.
30. public visibility consumes more gas than external as args of public fns need to be copied from calldata to memory of EVM, and for external it can be left at calldata
31. look for DEAD code i.e. unused/unreachable code
32. look for UNUSED fn return values. Indicates unchecked return values or missing logic at the fn call sites
33. look for UNUSED state/local vars ⇒ missing logic or (gas) optimisation
34. REDUNDANT fn statements might have side effects
35. Compiler Bugs (to understand their complexity):
    1. 0.4.7 - 0.5.10: ABIEncoderV2: storage Type[] = int[] ⇒ data corruption. Type = uint, bool, etc
    2. 0.4.16 - 0.5.9: ABIEncoderV2: if constructor args were dynamic arrays, it reverted or decoded to invalid data
    3. 0.4.6 - 0.5.10: ABIEncoderV2: storage arrays with structs or static arrays as elements, were not read properly when they were directly encoded using external calls (??) or abi.encode() (??)
    4. 0.5.6 - 0.5.11: ABIEncoderV2: calldata Structs with dynamically encoded (??) AND statically sized members resulted in incorrect values being read
    5. 0.5.0 - 0.5.7: ABIEncoderV2: Packed storage: storage structs/arrays with types < 32 bytes, when encoded using ABIEncoderV2 (??) caused data corruption
    6. 0.5.14 - 0.5.15: ABIEncoderV2 + YUL Optimizer: MLOAD/SLOAD calls were replaced with stale values
    7. 0.6.0 - 0.6.8: ABIEncoderV2: accessing array slices with dynamically encoded base types (??), resulted in invalid data being read
    8. 0.5.14 - 0.6.8: ABIEncoderV2: string literals with ‘\\’ for escaping, rendered different string, when passed directly to encoding (??) or external fn calls
    9. 0.5.5 - 0.5.6: Optimizer enabled, double bitwise shifts (??), for large constants whose sum overflowed 256 bits, the shifting operations overflowed (??)
    10. 0.5.5 - 0.5.7: doing index-based access of bytes1, byte2, bytes4….,bytes32, ‘byte’ in assembly returns unexpected value, as byte opcodes with second arg as 31 or constant expression which evaluates to 31, had a bug
    11. 0.5.8 - 0.5.16, 0.6.0 - 0.6.1: YUL Optimizer: assignments to vars declared inside for loops were removed, while using YUL’s continue/break statement (?? as outside for loop, value anyways won’t retain as var was declared inside loop)
    12. 0.3.0 - 0.5.17: derived contract was able to override a private fn in base contract
    13. 0.1.6 - 0.6.6: tuple assignments with multiple stack slots for eg: nested tuples, resulted in invalid values
    14. fixed in 0.7.3: dynamic arrays when assigned to types ≤ 16B (??), the supposedly deleted slots in the shrunk dynamic array, were not zeroed out by compiler, hence dirty data being reused in computations
    15. fixed in 0.7.4: empty byte array when copied from memory/calldata to storage, and then if target array’s size is increased without adding new data in it, it resulted in data corruption (?? what data is corrupted as src array is empty?)
    16. 0.2.0 - 0.6.5: very large memory arrays resulted in overlapping memory regions
    17. 0.6.9 - 0.6.10: library fn parameters which were ‘calldata’ were read incorrectly when called by ‘using for’ types
    18. 0.7.1 - 0.7.2: free fns were allowed to be declared with same name/parameters
36. Proxy-contract bugs:
    1. state vars in impl contract MUST NOT BE initialized OUTSIDE of initialize(), as they’ll not be set when delegate call is made to them
    2. contracts imported, should also follow proxy-based contract rules of no-constructor, only once callable initialize() and (a.)
    3. avoid using selfdestruct() and delegateCall() (??) inside impl contract as these mess with state of impl contract and not proxy contract
    4. on upgrading impl contract for a given proxy, ENSURE Order/Layout/Type/Mutability of state vars stays the SAME
    5. Fn Collision: Ensure you’re calling the right proxy contract as a malicious proxy might declare a fn with same fn ID (selector) as that of impl contract, in which case incorrect logic gets executed in malicious proxy
    6. Function Shadowing: ensure there are NO function ID (i.e. fn selector) COLLISIONS between proxy and impl contract. As such a collision will result in proxy fn being executed instead of impl fn

## Security Pitfalls, Best Practices 201

1. Block 1 has basic ERC20 checks - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGM1SF8twmw&list=PLYORQHvGMg-Urml835vJRec_hbPJYIb33)
2. Fees taken out from transfers, and interest generated added to transfers result in token deflation and inflation respectively. See if app logic considers these in its accounting logic.
3. Block 2 - first 7 min, peculiar token standards with different flavours of features like black/whitelisting, censorship etc
4. Guarded launch can be applied to: asset limits, asset types, user limits, usage limits (tx size/volume, daily/rate limit), composability limits, escrow (high value txns and pass/revert them via timelock/gov. Remove them later on), circuit breaker (pause/unpause, later remove), emergency shutdown (when circuit breaking doesn’t help, remove later to unguard)
5. System specs (design): requirements ⇒ design ⇒ detailed specs (why and how) ⇒ evaluate
6. System docs (actual impl): what and how. assets/actors/actions, trust/threat model. specify ⇒ implement ⇒ document ⇒ evaluate
7. Fn parameters: input validation. Fn args: order and type at call sites should match fn params
8. Ensure fn return values are checked and used
9. Fn timeliness, repetitiveness, order
10. (Asset) Access Control Spec: assets/actors/actions, who/what/why/when/how-much, trust/threat mode & assumptions, specify ⇒ implement ⇒ enforce ⇒ evaluate
11. Comments: should include rationale, assumptions
12. Testing: unit/functional/integration/regression(tests for code changes, revisions)/E2E. Smoke(overall func)/stress(extreme cases)/perf/security
13. Check if initialisation of imp contract vars (fns and state vars) is done correctly
14. Ensure cleanup of old state is done neatly.
15. Audit logging: emitting events for critical changes in system
16. Cryptography: keys, accounts, hashes, signs, randomness. Also ECDSA, keccak-256, BLS, RANDAO, VDF, ZK
17. Any behaviour not defined in specs: undefined behaviour
18. Challenge constancy assumptions of constant values
19. Freshness: txn nonce, oracle price
20. Challenge incentive, privacy assumptions
21. Forks: context, assumptions, bugs, fixes

### Saltzer and Schroeder’s 10 Secure Design Principles:

1. Least possible privilege to one and all.
2. Privilege separation: multi-sig vs EOA
3. Least Common Mechanism: reduce as many common points of failure (between multiple actors) as possible
4. Fail-safe Defaults: start the system with fail-safe default valued params, then open it up to more values later. Eg: guarded launch
5. Complete Mediation: enforce access control to ALL assets/actors/actions along ALL paths, at ALL times
6. Economy of Mechanism: KISS principle for system design
7. Open Design: system design should not be secret
8. Psychological Acceptability: all security practices, system design should lead to cozy UI/UX for ease of human use and so they can apply protection mechanisms easily, with minimal risk
9. Work Factor: cost of circumventing the mechanism vs resources of potential attack. Resources are high coz of high potential rewards and cost of circumventing is low in web3
10. Compromise Recording: high alert systems to mitigate attack damages. Incident response plans, constant contracts monitoring

### Audit Characteristics

1. Types: New/Repeat, Fix - review of fixes from past audit, Retainer - continuous audit, Incident - exploit review/fix
2. Pre-requisites: clear scope, repository, team, specification, documentation, threat model, prior reviews, timeline/effort/cost, engagement mode, point of contact
3. Bugs classification (ToB style): access control, auditing/logging, authentication, configuration, cryptography, data exposure (unintended exposure of data), data validation, DoS, error reporting, patching, session mgmt (identification of authenticated users), timing
4. Process: read spec/docs ⇒ fast tools ⇒ manual analysis ⇒ slow/deep tools ⇒ discuss findings (with fellow auditors) ⇒ convey status ⇒ iterate ⇒ write report ⇒ deliver report ⇒ evaluate fixes
   1. Read spec/docs: specs - why?, docs - how?
   2. Fast tools: for common pitfalls/best practices, MIGHT have false positives and negatives eg: slither, maru
   3. Manual analysis: most critical aspect. Manually compare spec with impl
    1. Access control: correct, complete, consistent access of actors over assets/contracts
    2. Asset Flow: who/when/which/why/where/what type/how much
    3. Control Flow: execution order
    4. Data Flow: intra and inter procedural data flow
    5. Inferring constraints: both solidity/EVM level and business/app logic level. With no spec/doc, constraints can be inferred from maximally occurring paths
    6. Dependencies: external code/data. Libraries/protocols/oracles, composability
    7. **Assumptions**: identify and verify them
    8. Checklists: ‘experts needs checklists’. Maintain one to avoid missed vulns
    9. Exploit scenarios: PoC with code/description. 
    10. Likelihood: probability/difficulty, Impact: magnitude of implications, Severity: Likelihood + Impact
5. Slow/Deep tools: formal verification/symbolic/fuzzing. False positives smtms challenging to evaluate, BUT true positives are as good as missed by best manual analysis. Eg: Echidna, MythX

### Audit Analysis Techniques

1. Specification (manual): assets/actors/actions, who/what/why/how
2. Documentation: implementation details
3. Testing: unit/functional/integration/e2e/smoke
4. Static Analysis: technique to analyse program properties, without executing it. eg slither, maru (from CD)
5. Fuzzing: automated software testing using invalid, unexpected, random inputs. eg echidna, harvey (from CD)
6. Symbolic checking: technique to check program correctness using symbolic inputs to represent states and transitions, instead of real inputs to enumerate all states/transitions separately. eg manticore, mythril
7. Formal verification: is proving/disproving the correctness of algorithms/programs with respect to formal specification of property, using formal methods of mathematics ⇒ for complex bugs not easily found using manual analysis, simpler tools. It needs specification of the program being verified and techniques to compare specification with actual implementation. Eg: certora prover, VerX (CD’s), KEVM (Runtime verification’s)
8. Manual Analysis: slow, inconsistent, non-scalable, error-prone, but the only way to analyse business/app logic
9. False positive: wasn’t a vuln but was reported. False negative: was a vuln but wasn’t reported. True negatives: missed findings or findings that were analysed and dismissed coz they were not vuln. Positive/Negative: reported or not.
10. Security Tools: testing, test coverage, linting, static analysis, symbolic checkers, fuzzing, formal verification, visualizers, disassemblers, monitoring
11. Slither (static analysis tool)
    1. Detector API: to write custom analyses using python
    2. SlithIR: slither intermediate representation, for simple and high-precision analysis
    3. Detectors: 75+ detectors for eg: reentrancy-eth, unprotected-upgrade, truffle/hardhat/embark/etherlime/dapp, in/exclude specific detectors
    4. Printers: control-flow graph, call graph, contract summary, inheritance, fns, modifiers, vars, dependencies, SlihtIR, EVM-level
    5. Upgradeability: for Delegate call proxy pattern vulns
    6. Code Similarity: detect similar solidity fns using ML trained models from etherscan verified 60k contracts, 850k fns. Esp. useful for forks
    7. Flat: contract flattening tool. 3 strategies: exporting most derived contracts, exporting all contracts in 1 file, local import: exports every contract in 1 separate file. Handles circular deps, supports truffle, hardhat etc
    8. Slither-Format: auto-generate git-compatible patches/fixes for few detectors like unused state, naming convention, external fn, solc version pragma and more
    9. ERC Conformance: checking conformity with ERC-20, 721, 777, 165, 223, 1820
    10. Slither-Prop: to generate code properties/invariants for testing with unit tests or Echidna (automatically??). Some ERC20 scenarios can also be tested
    11. New Detectors: arch for anyone to add new detectors
12. Manticore: symbolic execution tool. Explore vast program states with symbolic inputs and auto-generate inputs for any desirable program state. Has python API for programmatic access to its analysis engine
13. Echidna: fuzzing tool with 10 features. 3 steps to run:
    1. Execute test runner contract + invariants. Returns counterexample if one of the call sequences is able to falsify the invariant.
14. Ethersplay: EVM disassembler tool. Binary ninja (reverse engineering platform for binaries) plugin that takes EVM bytecode as input and displays control flow graphs of all fns. Can also be used to display Manticore’s coverage
15. Pyevmasm: assembler/disassembler tool for EVM. Provides CLI and python API for dis/assembling EVM.
16. Rattle: EVM Binary static analysis tool. Takes EVM byte strings as input, does flow-sensitive analysis (that considers control flow of statements. path-sensitive, context-sensitive analyses are others) to return control-flow graph, which is then converted to SSA (single static assignment) form with infinite registers, optimised by removing stacked instructions of DUPs, SWAPs, PUSHes, POPs, to make it more legible for analysing smart contracts
17. EVM CFG builder: tool to extract control-flow graph, fn names, attributes (payable, view etc) from EVM bytecode. Used by Ethersplay, Manticore, others.
18. Crytic Compile: smart contract compilation library which supports solc, truffle, embark, etherscan, brownie etc. Used in slither, echidna, manticore etc
19. Solc-Select: security helper tool to quickly switch between solc versions of the projects 
20. Etheno: testing tool. **JSON RPC multiplexer** (allows interacting with multiple eth clients at same time), **analysis tool wrapper** to Manticore, Echidna by providing a json rpc client for the tools hence devs don’t need to write custom scripts to use these tools, and i**ntegrates with truffle, ganache** to allow local test network setup with 1 command and easily bootstrap manticore analysis ⇒ hence called swiss army knife for eth testing
21. MythX (CD’s)
    1. 46+ detectors, Maru (static) + Mythril (symbolic) + Harvey (fuzzing), API-based. 
    2. Coverage covers all points (46+) from SWC (smart contract weakness classification) registry.
    3. Code needs to be submitted to their server for analysis in TLS encrypted fashion. Offered as security-as-a-service as running on cloud is more performant than locally.
    4. MythX Privacy ensures code being shared is via TLS encryption and is not shared to anyone else in their servers. Results are also authed.
    5. Performance: 3 scans ⇒ quick (5 min), standard (30 min), deep (90 min)
    6. Access Modes: CLI, mythx.js, PythX, VSCode
22. Scribble (CD’s): verification tool. 1) annotate contract with specs using scribble lang 2) scribble converts these annotations to concrete assertions in this new contract which is equivalent to original 3) this new contract can now be used for MythX
23. Fuzzing-as-a-service (CD’s): uses Harvey to fuzz
24. **Karl (CD’s):** real-time monitoring tool for newly deployed ethereum smart contracts and checking their vulns using Mythril
25. Theo: exploitation tool for smart contracts, also frontrun/backrun txns etc
26. **Visual Auditor:** VSCode extension must-have for manual analysis. Security-aware syntax/semantic highlighting, call graphs, and lot more for solidity, vyper
27. **Surya**: visualisation tool integrated with (26), for call graphs, inheritance graphs. Commands: graph/ftrace/flatten/describe etc
28. SWC Registry: 1 place for ALL publicly known vulns by CD. 36 entries
29. Securify (CS):  static analysis tool written in Datalog. 38+ detectors
30. VerX (CS): formal verification tool that auto-proves temporal safety (??) of SCs. Based on 1) reducing temporal safety to reachability 2) efficient symbolic checking engine 3) delayed abstraction of states
31. Karl (SmartDec): extensible static analyser
32. K-Framework (RV): verification framework (??) that uses KEVM (first executable EVM spec). Serves as platform for building wide range of formal analysis (??) tools for EVM
33. Certora Prover: formal verification tool. Rules need to be written in ‘Specify’ language which are verified by symbolic checking for all possible paths and spits counterexample if any. Uses ‘abstract interpretation’ and ‘constraint solving’ (2 fundamental computer science techniques)
34. HEVM (DappHub): EVM impl used for unit/property testing and interactive debugging
